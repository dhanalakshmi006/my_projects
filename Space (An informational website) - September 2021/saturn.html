	<h1> Saturn </h1>
	<p> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, with the largest planetary rings in the Solar System. It is the second-largest planet after Jupiter, and recently, with many other moons being discovered, it surpassed the number of Jupiter’s moons and is now considered the planet with the most numerous satellites. </p>
	<h2> Formation </h2> 
	<p> Saturn formed together with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together and thus the gas giant was created. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun. </p>
 <h2> Distance, Size and Mass </h2> 
	<p>Saturn is about 9.5 times farther away from the Sun than Earth. At a distance of 9.6 AU away from the Sun and 10.6 AU away from Earth, it is the sixth most distant planet.

Light takes approximately 1 hour and 29 minutes to travel from Saturn and then arrive at Earth. It is the second-largest planet in the Solar System, having a radius of 58.232 km or 36.183 mi, about nine times that of Earth and a diameter of 120.536 km or 74.897 mi, almost 9.5 times bigger than the diameter of Earth.

The surface area is about 83 times bigger than our planet, and the mass of Saturn is about 95 times greater. </p> <br> <img class="img" src="saturn2.jpg" > <br>
<h2> Structure </h2>
<p> Predominately composed out of hydrogen and helium, Saturn’s density is the lowest out of all the planets in the Solar System, having no true surface just like Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.It does have a dense core in the center, composed out of water, ice, and rocky materials, but no actual landmass. The core is believed to be similar to that of Jupiter – rocky, enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer with traces of various ices.

The interior is very hot at the core – 12.000 K / 11,700 °C – and it radiates 2.5 times the amount of energy it produces into space than it receives from the Sun. It is estimated that the core’s mass is about 9-22 times bigger than that of Earth. This would result in a diameter of 25.000 km/15.534 mi or almost two times the size of Earth.

The thick liquid metallic hydrogen layer followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000 km / 621 mi and consists of gas.</p> <br><img class="img2" src="saturn3.png">
<h2> Life Habitability </h2> <p> Since it doesn’t have a true surface, but rather swirling fluids, it is not conducive to life as we know it. The moons of Saturn however, respectively Titan and Enceladus, have internal oceans that could possibly hold life. </p>
<h2>Rotation</h2> <p> Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system, completing a rotation quite quickly, in about 10.6 hours. However, its orbit around the Sun is slow, completing one trip around the Sun or a year, in about 29.5 Earth years. Its average orbital speed is about 9.68 km/s - 6.01 mi/s.<br> 
The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° relative to the orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU, on average. </p> <br> <img src="saturn4.jpg"> <br>
