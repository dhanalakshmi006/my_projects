	<h1> Uranus </h1>
	<p> Uranus is the seventh planet discovered in the Solar System that also led to the discovery of the last planet, Neptune they are both referred to as ice giants. Officially recognized in 1781 after many observations in the past, it is the third-largest planet of the Solar System. </p>
	<h2> Formation </h2> 
	<p> Through simulations after the Nice model, it has been suggested that both Uranus and Neptune formed closer to the sun and later drifted away. It is hypothesized that the Solar System formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the pre-solar nebula. Much of it formed the Sun while more of its dust went on and merged to create the first proto-planets. As they grew, some accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold unto the nebula’s leftover gas. Estimates suggest the creation to have taken place about 4.5 billion years ago, and the drifting about 4 billion. </p>
 <h2> Distance, Size and Mass </h2> 
	<p>Since its discovery, the planet has shifted it 1° west every 72 years however, its average distance from the sun still remains about 20 AU or 2 billion kilometers – 2 billion miles. The difference between its furthest and closest point from the sun is about 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet with the exception of the dwarf planet Pluto. </p> <br> <img class="img" src="uranus1.jpg" > <br> <br><p> Though its mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, it is the least massive compared to the other giant planets, having a mass of 8.681 × 10^25 kg. However, its diameter is slightly larger than that of Neptune, and it’s about four times that of Earth: about 51.118 kilometers or 31.763 miles.

The density of Uranus 1.27 g/cm3 makes it the second least dense planet, after Saturn. This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices such as water, ammonia, and methane. The mass of its interior is however debatable, it is speculated to be around 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses.

 </p>
<h2> Structure </h2>
<p> The standard model structure of Uranus consists of three layers: a rocky silicate/iron-nickel core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.

The core’s mass is estimated to be about 0.55% Earth masses with a radius less than 20% of the whole of Uranus. The mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses. The upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5 Earth masses and expanding for the last 20% of Uranus’s radius. The core density is around 9 g/cm3, with a pressure in the middle of about 8 million bars, and a temperature of about 5.000 K. What is referred to as the ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles. </p> <br><img class="img2" src="uranus2.jpg">
<h2> Life Habitability </h2> <p> Since it doesn’t have a true surface but rather swirling fluids it is not conducive to life as we know it. </p>
<h2>Rotation </h2> <p>It takes Uranus about 7 years to pass through each zodiac constellation, and a total of 84 years to make a complete trip around the sun. Its interesting orbing caught the attention of astronomers because the planet escaped its predicted location, and thus it led to the discovery of the last planet in 1846 that would later be called Neptune. </p> <br><img src="uranus3.jpg">
