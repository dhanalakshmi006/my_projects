	<h1> Jupiter </h1>
	<p> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet of the Solar System. It is the oldest planet of the Solar System thus it was the first to take shape out of the remains of the solar nebula. </p>
	<h2> Formation </h2> 
	<p> Throughout the universe, there are many planetary systems similar to ours. Most of them contain terrestrial planets like our own and gas giants like Jupiter. However, they also contain super-Earths – planets that are several times more massive than Earth.

This indicates that our own Solar System should also have these types of planets and it is hypothesized that we did have them but they collided with Jupiter in the early formation of the Solar System. This resulted in Jupiter’s migration from the inner solar system to the outer solar system and thus allowed the inner solar planets to form. This theory is called the Grand Tack Hypothesis.

There are theories that hypothesize the fact that Jupiter may have formed before the Sun while others state that Jupiter formed after the sun about 4.5 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust and resulted in the creation of Jupiter. Sometime around 4 billion years ago Jupiter settled in its current position in the outer solar system. </p> 
	<h2> Distance, Size and Mass </h2> 
	<p> It is the fifth most distant from the Sun with an average distance of about 5.2 AU. The closest approach is at 4.9 AU and at its farthest 5.4 AU. Its exact position can be checked online since the planet is constantly tracked.</p> <br> <img class="img" src="jupiter1.jpg" > <br> <br>
	<p> It is the biggest planet of the Solar System, with a mean radius of 43.440 miles / 69.911 km. Almost 11 times bigger than Earth. Jupiter's radius is about 1/10 the radius of the Sun, and its mass is 0.001 times the mass of the Sun, so the densities of the two bodies are similar.

The diameter at the equator of about 88.846 mi / 142.984 km, and at the poles, the diameter is only 83.082 mi / 133.708 km. The average density of Jupiter is about 1.326 g/cm3, much smaller than all the terrestrial planets.

Jupiter is also 2.5 times more massive than all the other planets combined, having 318 times the mass of Earth. It has a volume of about 1,321 Earths. </p> 

<h2> Structure </h2>
<p>Jupiter does not have a solid surface being comprised mostly out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, 10% helium – very similar to the sun. </p> 

<br><img class="img2" src="jupiter2.png"> <br> <br> <p> It is now known if Jupiter has a core and recent analysis suggests that the atmosphere extends up to 3.000 km / 1.864 mi down, and beneath this is an ocean of metallic hydrogen going all the way down to the center. About 80-90% of its radius is now believed to be liquid or technically - electrically conducting plasma – it may be similar to liquid mercury. The Juno mission will reveal more about Jupiter’s inner structure and if indeed it has a core. </p>
<h2> Rotation </h2> <p> Jupiter rotates once every 10 hours – A Jovian day - thus it has the shortest day of all the planets in the solar system. A Jovian year, on the other hand, is about 12 Earth years, quite long in comparison to its short days. The orbital period is about two-fifths that of Saturn. The orbit of Jupiter is elliptical, inclined about 1.31 degrees when compared to Earth. <br> The eccentricity of the orbit is about 0.048. This results in its distance from the Sun varying from its perihelion to aphelion by about 75 million km / 46 mi. Jupiter’s upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation since it’s made out of gases.

<h2>Planetary Rings</h2> <p> Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.

They appear to be made out of dust rather than ice as with Saturn’s rings. It is believed that the main ring is made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis.

In a similar manor, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring.</p> <br> <img src="jupiter4.jpg">
