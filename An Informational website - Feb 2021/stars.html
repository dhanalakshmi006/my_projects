	<p> Stars are large balls made up of gas that creates and emits its own radiation.<br> 
	Our Sun (a star) and all the planets around it are part of the Milky Way Galaxy.<br> 
	Milky Way is a large group of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity. <br>
	They come in a variety of shapes and sizes.<br> 
	All the stars we see in the night sky are in our own Milky Way Galaxy.<br> 
	It is very difficult to count the number of stars in the Milky Way from our position inside the galaxy. Our best estimates tell us that the Milky Way is made up of approximately 100 billion stars. These stars form a large disk whose diameter is about 100,000 light years. Our Solar System is about 25,000 light years away from the center of our galaxy â€“ we live in the suburbs of our galaxy. Just as the Earth goes around the Sun, the Sun goes around the center of the Milky Way. It takes 250 million years for our Sun and the solar system to go all the way around the center of the Milky Way. <br>

	<h3> At night, we can see about 4000 stars with our naked eyes. <br>
Stars are gigantic spheres of hot gas. <br>
Sun appears to be larger than all others stars in the sky because of its being nearest to us, there are billions of stars which have higher or lower mass size and temperature than those of the Sun. <br> 
Hydrogen makes up for 72% of the mass of the Sun while helium is 26%. The rest 2% is made up of elements heavier than helium.</h3></div>
